This week I attended an event put on by the [Tampa Artificial Intelligence Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Artificial-Intelligence-Meetup): [
Finding State of the Art Techniques through Open Competitions](https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Artificial-Intelligence-Meetup/events/268349608/). It was a smaller event, with maybe 7 people attending, but very welcoming and informative.

The organizer, [Scott Mueller](https://github.com/meanderingstream), gave a presentation introducing us (me?) to [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and talking about using machine learning algorithms to solve different image recognition problems. You can find the presentation [slides here](https://meanderingstream.github.io/competitions_state_of_art/#/).

The presentation kicked off with a quick discussion about learning rate and its importance to/impact on model performance (a topic that had been discussed at a previous meetup). This was used to segue into a discussion of fast.ai, and some competitions they are running on image recognition. The first of these was [*imagenette*](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) (which apparently is to be pronounced with a caricature of a french accent). This led to *imagewoof*, and eventually *imagewang*.

We also reviewed a [sample Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/muellerzr/Practical-Deep-Learning-For-Coders/blob/master/02b_SOTA.ipynb) from the competition as an example.

The next meetup for this group is next week and should involve a review of a couple papers:

* [Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01991)

* [Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)

Should be interesting.
