      <description>This week I finally made it back to the Code for Tampa Bay Meetup. C4TB is a Code for America brigade located in Tampa, FL. I had joined the organization in early 2019 looking to find a way to contribute to our community, but had recently gotten out of the habit of attending. So, when one of the organizers told me they were looking to reboot and redouble their efforts, I felt like it was a good opportunity to try again.</description>

      <description>This week I attended an event put on by the Tampa Artificial Intelligence Meetup entitled &amp;ldquo;Finding State of the Art Techniques through Open Competitions&amp;rdquo;. It was a smaller event, with maybe 7 people attending, but welcoming, accessible, and informative.
The organizer, Scott Mueller, gave a presentation introducing us (maybe only me?) to fast.ai and how to use machine learning algorithms to solve different image recognition problems. You can find the slides here.</description>
