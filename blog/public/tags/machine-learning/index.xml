      <description>I picked up this book to learn more about machine learning on Azure. While it is a good book, and one I would recommend, I found some of the hands-on sections challenging. I put together some resources to help anyone else that experiences those same difficulties. If you are reading this, then that might be you.
I thought Part I. of the book, an overview of machine learning and explanation of how it works, was clear.</description>
