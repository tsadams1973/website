      <description>I attended a Microsoft Tech Talk today at the Microsoft Tampa office. Buck Woody gave a wonderful talk on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
It was a great event, both logistically seamless and full of useful content. Check out the resources included in the links above to learn more. It is amazing all of the tools and services that are available today and some of the ways people are using them.</description>
