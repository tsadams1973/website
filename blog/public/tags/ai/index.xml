      <description>As part of my effort to learn more about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Azure, I have been reading Deep Learning with Azure. Having just finished Part II: Azure AI Platform and Experimentation Tools, I thought I might write up my experiences working with computer vision and custom vision while they are still fresh in my mind.
Despite the majority of my professional programming experience being in C#, I decided to use Python to work through the examples.</description>

      <description>This week I attended an event put on by the Tampa Artificial Intelligence Meetup entitled &amp;ldquo;Finding State of the Art Techniques through Open Competitions&amp;rdquo;. It was a smaller event, with maybe 7 people attending, but welcoming, accessible, and informative.
The organizer, Scott Mueller, gave a presentation introducing us (maybe only me?) to fast.ai and how to use machine learning algorithms to solve different image recognition problems. You can find the slides here.</description>

      <description>I attended a Microsoft Tech Talk today at the Microsoft Tampa office. Buck Woody gave a wonderful talk on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
It was a great event, both logistically seamless and full of useful content. Check out the resources included in the links above to learn more. It is amazing all of the tools and services that are available today and some of the ways people are using them.</description>

      <title>Practical Automated Machine Learning on Azure</title>
      <link>https://timblog.z19.web.core.windows.net/posts/azure-practical-ml-book/</link>

      <description>I picked up this book to learn more about machine learning on Azure. While it is a good book, and one I would recommend, I found some of the hands-on sections challenging. I put together some resources to help anyone else that experiences those same difficulties. If you are reading this, then that might be you.
I thought Part I., Automated MachineLearning, of the book, an overview of machine learning and explanation of how it works, was clear.</description>
