      <description>This week I attended an event put on by the Tampa Artificial Intelligence Meetup entitled &amp;ldquo;Finding State of the Art Techniques through Open Competitions&amp;rdquo;. It was a smaller event, with maybe 7 people attending, but welcoming, accessible, and informative.
The organizer, Scott Mueller, gave a presentation introducing us (maybe only me?) to fast.ai and how to use machine learning algorithms to solve different image recognition problems. You can find the slides here.</description>
