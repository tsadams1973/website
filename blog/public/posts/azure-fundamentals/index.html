<p>I have decided to purse some Azure certifications to improve my understanding of the product and bolster my resume. I generally like to start these types of efforts at the beginning, which means revisiting the fundamentals to ensure I have a good foundation. So, for this particular journey that means starting with an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-fundamentals.aspx">Azure Fundamentals certification</a> by taking the AZ-900 exam.</p>

<p>To keep it interesting, I though I might takes notes on the process here as I work through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/">free training</a> Microsoft provides.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/">Microsoft training</a> is broken down into the following modules:</p>

<p><strong>Module 1:</strong> <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/index">Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing</a></em></p>

<p><em>Summary:</em><br />
This module starts off by introducing the idea of cloud computing as a utility, similar to electricity. Cloud providers typically offer compute power, storage, networking, and analytics. Compute offerings include VMs, containers, or serverless options. Storage offerings can scale based on need. Cloud computing can be flexible and cost efficient. It is based on a pay-as-you-go model. Cloud resources can scale vertically (adding more CPU&rsquo;s or memory) or horizontally (adding more servers). Cloud resources are elastic, so they can scale up and down as needed. Cloud computing is also current, reliable, and secure. Cloud providers can help compliance with regulations and standards (includes a list of compliance offerings). Cloud spending will be operational expenses (OpEx) rather than the capital expenses (CapEx) of traditional on-premise offerings. Cloud deployment models define where your resources are stored and how your customers interact with them. You can choose public cloud (everything in the cloud), private cloud (everything on premise), or hybrid (some things in the public cloud some in the private cloud) models. In addition to cloud deployment models, there are three types of cloud services: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). IaaS is akin to renting hardware from a cloud provider to run your systems: but you are still responsible for managing the operating systems, etc. PaaS, on the other hand, is a complete environment into which you can deploy your applications. With SaaS you are basically using software in the cloud over the web on a subscriptions service. The module ends with a quick quiz (knowledge check) and a summary. Overall I found this module took about 46 minutes to complete, versus the 62 minutes Microsoft estimated.</p>

<p><strong>Module 2:</strong> <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/index">Core Cloud Services - Introduction to Azure</a></em></p>

<p>Summary:<br />
This module introduces Azure, Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud computing platform. A quick video describes you to how Azure works at a high level, introducing the concept of virtualization with hypervisor, and the fundamental orchestrator and fabric controller architecture that powers Azure. A quick overview of Azure services lists the most commonly used: compute, networking, storage, mobile, databases, web, internet of things, big data, AI, and DevOps. You receive a brief description of each of these services before jumping in to create your own website. This will be done in an App Service, which is an http-based service that you can use to host web-based solutions without needing to manage infrastructure. Following along with the tutorial, we activate our development sandbox, login to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure Portal</a>, and create a resource. We choose &lsquo;WordPress&rsquo; to create a WordPress app and hit &lsquo;Create&rsquo;. The tutorial gives you some values to enter. Make sure to read all the steps first, because you need to create a new service plan. If you try to create the app using the pre-filled service plan, it will fail. Once everything is configured hit &lsquo;Create&rsquo; and wait for your app to deploy. Once deployment is complete, go to your resource in the azure portal. The overview page will show you the URL for it. Follow that to see your WordPress site up and running. After launching our site, we are invited to revisit the app in the portal. Looking at the overview page, we can see some graphs about the usage of our site, number of requests, data-in and data-out, etc. If we wanted to scale-up our app service to handle more load, we can do this with the scale-up option found in the app service&rsquo;s settings. (This would involve choosing a different pricing tier than we set in the original configuration.) Finally we learn a bit about Azure Cloud Shell, which is a browser based CLI for programmatically managing your Azure resources. The module runs us through some commands to list different azure resources associated with our subscription and eventually start and stop our app service from the command line. Again, the module ends with a quiz and summary. Unlike the last module, I found this one took about 59 minutes to complete versus the Microsoft estimate of 36 minutes. I&rsquo;m sure the extra time was spent on the hands-on exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Module 3:</strong> <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-azure-infrastructure/index">Core Cloud Services - Azure architecture and service guarantees</a></em></p>

<p>Summary:<br />
Azure is effectively a bunch of data centers located around the world. Rather than expose any one specific data center to users, though, they are grouped into regions, which are geographical areas that contain at least one data center. When you create a new resource, you assign it to a region, and Azure will intelligently manage the resource within that region to optimize service. In addition to regions, Azure has what are called <em>geographies</em>, which are groups of regions aligned to geopolitical or country borders. These are helpful for fault tolerance (if a region in a geography fails) and to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. The geographies are: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East/Africa. Azure also has <em>availability zones</em>, which are independent data centers within regions that are connected by high-speed fiber optic cables. If one zone goes down, the others continue working. Note: not every region currently supports availability zones, but the list that does is expanding. For high availability, you can host your resources in one zone and replicate them to another for redundancy. In addition to availability zones withing regions, all regions also have <em>region pairs</em>, which are other regions at least 300 miles away which can also be used to replicate resources (in the case that a large enough problem could take down an entire region). Service-level Agreements (SLAs) are Microsoft&rsquo;s commitment to providing customers with specific performance standards. They have three characteristics: performance targets, uptime and connectivity guarantees, and service credits (which represent credits the customer receives if the guaranteed levels of service are not met). SLAs combined across services are called composite SLAs. You can calculate composite SLAs based on the individual SLAs of the components and how they interact in your specific architecture. You can set your own expected performance targets for the applications you run in Azure by creating an <em>Application SLA</em>. As failures are inevitable, we should aim for resiliency instead of failure avoidance. Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failure and continue to operate. To design for resiliency we should start with a Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) to identify possible points of failure and identify how the application will respond to them. Availability is the amount of time a system is functioning and working. Maximizing availability in a system often incurs costs, both monetarily and by the addition of complexity to the system. You should consider how critical availability is to any of your systems to know how to manage these tradeoffs. The module ends with a quiz, and took about 39 minutes compared to the estimated 45.</p>
