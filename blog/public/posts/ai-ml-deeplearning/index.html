			<p>I attended a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MTTFlorida/">Microsoft Tech Talk</a> today at the Microsoft Tampa office. <a href="https://github.com/BuckWoody">Buck Woody</a> gave a wonderful talk on <a href="https://buckwoody.github.io/presentations/ai_ml_dl/">Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a great event, both logistically seamless and full of useful content. Check out the resources included in the links above to learn more. It is amazing all of the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/">tools and services</a> that are available today and some of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ai">ways people are using them</a>. (I am particularly interested in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-health">AI for Health</a> program.)</p>

<p>Buck Woody was an excellent presenter, both engaging and with a strong grasp of the material. He started out by giving an overview of what data science is (<em>&lsquo;Applying rigor and process to collecting, analyzing and providing predictive and prescriptive action on the results.&rsquo;</em>) and what elements it comprises. He followed that with a brief history of artificial intelligence along with how both machine learning and deep learning relate to it. So, it was informative and framed the rest of the presentation well.</p>

<p>After the introduction he covered the three areas of the talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>For each section he gave some background on the theory behind it (in this case most of that theory was math), then showed some services, tools, and platforms that were available, and eventually walked through some examples.</p>

<p>I will leave the content for you to discover. I will also leave you with a recommendation to see Buck Woody speak sometime as he was funny and an entertaining presenter (even when talking about math). Definitely look at the slides: they include a number of notes as well as links to additional resources. You should also follow along with the Jupyter notebooks provided as examples.</p>

<p>While there is certainly a lot of hype surrounding AI, there are also a lot of tools available that you can use to help solve some of the real world problems that you, your organization, and your customers are facing today. This talk was a great introduction to some of those that Microsoft offers.</p>
